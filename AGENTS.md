# Agent Instructions

## Critical workflow

- Windows-first project: prefer PowerShell 7.6, Windows-native paths, and installed project tools unless there is a clear reason not to.
- After code changes, run `python build.py --skip-updates`; do not use `python build.py --version`!
- Always git commit after code changes!
- Before committing, run relevant tests/unit tests and ensure build/test results succeed.
- Commit completed code changes with plain git commands only: `git status`, `git add -A`, `git commit -m "<message>"`.
- Do not push to cloud unless explicitly requested, generally just commit locally!
- Always consult `llm-wiki/` for code, bug, build, test, config, debugging, or behavior work!
- Keep `llm-wiki/` linted / quality-checked and updated when durable project knowledge changes.
- Always update `llm-wiki/` after code changes!
- Mistrust code, code annotations and llm-wiki. Each of them might be stale our outdated. Come to your on conclusion and act based on that!
- Always consider adding regression tests and adding useful debug logging for every bug fix!

## Engineering rules

- Prefer root-cause fixes over workarounds; do not hide, ignore, weaken, or paper over failures.
- Make the smallest maintainable change that fully fixes the issue.
- Keep source files roughly 600-800 lines maximum; split files when needed.
- Do not make tests pass by deleting coverage, weakening assertions, suppressing errors, or changing expected behavior without justification.
- Do not introduce nor accept racy, timing-sensitive, or fragile behavior.
- Do not use sleeps, wait tables, polling delays, or timing bandaids as crash/race fixes.
- Perform thorough thinking about actual root causes of crashes and other issues!
- Do not try just mitigating fallout except of proper and solid root cause fixes!
- If the result after thorough thinking is that proper fixes require bigger changes, they generally should be performed!
- Treat dumps, logs, media, captures, credentials, private keys, tokens, symbols, and user data as sensitive.
- Do not commit secrets, dumps, logs, captures, private-symbol PDBs, large generated artifacts, or private user data.

## Non-negotiable project constraints

- Do not use D3D11On12 for the DX12 overlay; use native DX12.

## Build, diagnostics, and tests

- Keep relevant LSP, formatter, and linter diagnostics active for touched files when available.
- Fix introduced LSP errors/warnings; also fix safe, localized pre-existing diagnostics in touched files.
- Do not perform broad repo-wide diagnostic cleanup unless required by the change.
- Use LSP quick-fixes only when safe, deterministic, and behavior-preserving.
- If LSP is unavailable, stale, or misconfigured, state that and fall back to canonical build/test/lint commands.
- We are paranoid about having sufficient regression tests!
- Add focused regression tests where feasible, especially tests that would have failed before the fix.
- If no regression-test infrastructure exists for the area, consider adding suitable unit infrastructure such as GoogleTest.
- Do not add sleeps or timing assumptions to tests.
- Good tests verify behavior, not only code-path execution.
- Check whether touched/new code has sufficient unit coverage.

## Debugging and logging

- We are paranoid about having sufficient debug logging!
- Add additional debug logging when it helps diagnose root cause, state transitions, failure modes, unexpected runtime conditions, or future regressions.
- Ensure builds preserve useful debug symbols etc. so crash dumps contain actionable information.
- For media analysis, `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` are in `%USERPROFILE%\Programme\build\captureproject\build\msys64\clang64\bin`.

## Windows debugging and binary analysis tools

- When analyzing crash dumps, use the correct symbol path that includes both the Microsoft symbol server AND the local PDB directory:
```
cdb -z crash.dmp -y "srv*;%USERPROFILE%\Programme\build\captureproject\installed\captureengine" -c ".ecxr; k; q"
```
The `srv*`-only path misses CE's local PDBs and produces incomplete stack traces.

- Installed Windows tools for `.dmp`, symbol, PE/COFF, Sysinternals, and media/capture analysis. The paths below reflect the current tool report; versioned Visual Studio/MSVC components may still vary after toolchain updates.

## `llm-wiki/` workflow

- `llm-wiki/` is canonical LLM-maintained derived memory, not the sole source of truth.
- For substantial work, start with `llm-wiki/index.md`, read only relevant topic pages, then read `llm-wiki/log/recent.md` for active/stale-risk areas.
- Read archives only when historical context is needed or explicitly linked.
- For trivial localized edits, skip broad wiki loading unless the area is unfamiliar or stale-risk is likely.
- If `llm-wiki/` is missing during substantial work, create `index.md`, `overview.md`, and `log/recent.md` by inspecting repo structure, build/test entry points, config, docs, and workflows.
- Mistrust wiki claims until verified against code (but mistrust code too!), tests, build scripts, config, or observed behavior.
- Prefer updating existing pages over creating new ones; create new pages only for reusable topics.
- Keep topic pages focused on current best understanding; put chronology, partial investigations, and temporary notes in `llm-wiki/log/recent.md`.
- Mark uncertainty explicitly as open question, stale-risk, or unverified claim.
- Do not dump raw logs or long command output unless it establishes durable knowledge.
- Update the wiki when durable knowledge changes: architecture, behavior, build/test/package/deploy/debug workflows, bugs/root causes, invariants, conventions, rejected approaches, follow-ups, or code style.
- Do not update the wiki for trivial edits with no future-useful context.
- `llm-wiki/index.md` is a compact routing table with page link, purpose, last verified date, and stale-risk.
- Durable topic pages should include summary, source anchors, invariants, diagnostics/failure modes, open questions/stale-risk, and last verified details.
- `llm-wiki/log/recent.md` is newest-first rolling memory; archive older entries when it gets too long.
- After both wiki updates and code changes, perform a semantic quality check for contradictions, stale claims, duplicates, orphan pages, broken links, missing source anchors, and merge/delete/archive candidates.
